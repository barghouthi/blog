title: "Why is the private sector so inefficient? The immigrant paradox"

One day when I was a high school senior in Amman, Jordan, my classmate Mona’s parents were out of town and she decided to take the family car on a ride. She handed the keys over to Anwar, one of our classmates, who was unlicensed but supposedly knew how to drive.[^fn-names]
I remember seeing them happily zipping by the school. A few minutes later, Anwar lost control of the car and drove straight into the car garage of one of the houses around our school. Garages back there have heavy steel gates. They knocked out the garage door, destroyed the front and sides of the car, but managed to drive away unseen and hid the car somewhere. Word instantly spread amongst us at school. One of our enterprising classmates immediately contacted a mechanic who over the next few hours miraculously repaired the car and it was back at Mona’s house looking like nothing had happened. Mona’s parents, to my knowledge, have never known about the accident, and the school’s neighbors have never figured out who destroyed their garage gate. 

[^fn-names]: not their real names.

I owned my first car a few years ago when I moved to the US. My first car problem was minor: the right signal light bulb burned out. Knowing nothing about cars, I walked over to a Goodyear conveniently located right across the street from my apartment and explained the issue. The person on the front desk scribbled two numbers on a piece of paper, "1.5" and "60", and told me that it would cost me 61.5 dollars. I asked if they could fix it right then. "No, you have to keep the car here overnight and pick it up tomorrow,” he replied. I thanked him and left. I googled and figured out that the light bulb is 1.5 dollars and the whole process of replacing it is a 5 minute job, and probably much less if you’re an experienced mechanic. They literally could’ve changed the light bulb in the time I spent talking to their front-desk person.

Since then we’ve had a couple of more-involved car problems, like a slow-mo rear-end collision thanks to an icy Madison morning. While the damage was minor, first we had to wait to get an appointment at the dealership, the dealership had to inspect the car to figure out the depth of the damage, then they gave us a quote, then we had to wait three weeks for our real appointment, and then we had to leave the car there for a week for them to fix it.
(That's not mentioning that the insurance company made us get another quote for good measure.)

Why’s that? How come a random solo mechanic in Amman can resurrect a battered car in a few hours while, in the land of Henry Ford, it takes mechanics a whole day to change a light bulb?

As far as I can tell, this is a common observation amongst immigrants who arrive in the US from what we shall call, for the lack of a better term, developing countries: Compared to the developing world, many private-sector services appear wildly inefficient in the US, while government services are actually incredibly smooth. For example, renewing a passport in US is very simple: you mail a form and a passport materializes in a mailbox on the street. This is crazy smooth, and perhaps a national security risk? In Jordan, on the other hand, if you want to renew your passport, good luck *habibi*: you should take a week-long vacation to embark on an uncertain and undefined journey between government offices, collecting stamps and approvals, renewing superfluous documents, and receiving insults along the way. At some point, when you least expect it, an officer calls your name, hands you your new passport, and scolds you for the trouble you've caused them.

This is the paradox that I find quite interesting. It is an undisputed truth and a cliche in the US that the public sector is inefficient due to stifling bureaucracy and lazy civil servants in secure jobs, while the private sector is efficient, thanks to the power of competition and invisible limbs. But this is not necessarily the immigrant perspective.

What’s going on? Why are private services more efficient and convenient in the developing world?

One possible explanation is that the unemployment rate is usually high in developing countries, and so there’s lots of competition, particularly for jobs that a single person can perform, like many competing mechanics offering to fix your car. But unemployment is definitely not the right answer, at least not the full answer. 

I think the main reason for inefficiency of private-sector services is bloat: way too many people involved and way too many procedures and schemes. Let me illustrate.

Consider a standard doctor visit. Say you twisted your ankle playing basketball and you want to get it checked. Here’s my experience in the private healthcare system of the US: I book an appointment. I show up. I go to a desk to check in. They ask me questions about my insurance, whether I’ve moved, what’s my favorite pharmacy, etc. Then, they instruct me to go to the appropriate clinic. I inform the clinic’s front desk that I’m here. I wait. A nurse shows up, takes random measurements like weight and blood pressure, which I think are not directly related to ankles. The nurse then asks me about what I’m there for, frantically taking notes as I speak. The nurse leaves the room. A resident doctor shows up eventually, and asks me the same questions again. The doctor checks my ankle, then disappears. At some point the resident doctor shows up with the boss doctor, who apologizes for the wait. The boss doctor tells me that he's heard the resident doctor’s briefing and thinks it’s just a sprain, but proceeds to do the same ankle tests that the resident did. The boss doctor concludes that it’s just a sprain. I leave. 

Here’s an equivalent scenario in a developing country: I show up, possibly without an appointment. I give the front desk my name. I wait. The doctor eventually checks my ankle and concludes it’s just a sprain. I leave.

Clearly, my clinic is radically inefficient, at least from the point of view of someone who twisted an ankle and wants to get it checked. Bloat: too many people and too many procedures. 

Yes, blood-pressure and weight-fluctuation checks are important just-in-case checks. Yes, asking a person the same thing a thousand times is important to get the story right. Yes, it’s important to train new doctors. And yes, we need to document everything for insurance companies, liability, and for maintaining a complete health record. But, as far as I’m concerned, as a patient with a twisted ankle, they’ve wasted my time.[^fn-prog]

[^fn-prog]: For programmers: it feels like running a program compiled with debug flags.

Let me give another example. Buying a SIM card anywhere outside of North America is trivial. You show up at a store, they ask you if you want a lot of data or little data, and they hand you a SIM card. Have you tried going to an AT&T store, the company that invented cellular communication? The wait is insanely long. When they finally call your number, they show you a catalogue of plans, offers, deals, specials, rebates, and you have to somehow pick the one that fits your needs and maximizes bang for buck. Once you’ve made your choice, the AT&T employee proceeds to fill out a long form on the clumsy on-screen keyboard of a tablet! 

Why is it so hard to buy a SIM card? Bloat: too many people and too many processes and schemes. The marketing people want to make stores look technologically advanced, so they hand employees clumsy tablets. The sales people want to maximize profit, so they come up with a “plan” for every possible kind of customer. Ironically, all of this “optimization” ends up making customer experience miserable.

My hypothesis is that the more developed a nation is, the more bloat its private sector accrues, making even simple transactions slow and complicated. Developing countries tend to be chaotic, yet their markets are less bloated, making them agile and efficient.
